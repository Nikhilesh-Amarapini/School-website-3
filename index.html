    <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">Has established in 1978<p class="text-muted">The nature of Christian schools varies enormously from country to country, according to the religious, educational, and political cultures. In some countries, there is a strict separation of church and state, so all religious schools are private; in others, there is an established church whose teachings form an integral part of the state-operated educational system; in yet others, the state subsidizes religious schools of various denominations.</p></h5>

It is also supplied with periodicals and magazines and is a veritable treasure house of reference books and encyclopedias. Each class is given a library period where the students are to read the books and make review of them.</p></h5>

    <hr>
    <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">Has established in 1982<p class="text-muted">The stage has always been held in great honour at St. Xavier’s. For an educational institution an auditorium is not just a venue for school or college events, or merely a meeting place, it is a space where a corporation of students and scholars congregate to celebrate, to debate, to discuss, and sometimes even to mourn collectively. As we stand at the threshold of another century in the history of St. Xavier’s College, it is meet that we go down memory lane and find out how students gathered here when it all began 130 odd years ago, how this place changed over the century, and how it is now poised to provide a space for even greater creative, cultural and social events, something that St. Xavier’s College has always been noted for.</p></h5>

  <p>One Of The Winner's Parent Said This<br>The topic given was ‘Environment pollution’ and I was really excited as it is a topic close to my heart. The judges were from ABC Technical College, and the BCD University and they looked very stern and strict to me.

    Our team started off well as it had most of the ‘brain boxes’ of our school. Everyone contributed equally to the debate. In the end, when the judges announce the winner, we were overjoyed! The judges commented that though the B team fought well, it was the A team which had knowledge and fluency on its side!</p>>
